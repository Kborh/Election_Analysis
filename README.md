## Chanllenge Overview

AS a data analysis, i was asked by the Colorado election boad to complete an election aduit of a recent local 
congressional election. Below, are the following taks that was included in the audit.

I provided Seth and his team with the findings of the following tasks in my first draft of the election audit:
  
  1. Calculate the total number of votes cast. 
  2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes. 
  3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received. 
  4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won. 
  5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
  
Even though, the outcomes of the election are important, there are a few more key insights his team would like to review. 
The election commission of Seth's team asked if he could confirm the voter turnout for each county that voted in this congressional district.

The findings of the following tasks were added to the final election audit:

  1. Calculate the voter turnout for each county.
  2. Calculate the percentage of votes each county contributed to the election.
  3. Determine which county had the largest turnout.
